  <h2>코딩이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<h4>What is coding?</h4>
Coding, sometimes called <strong>computer programming</strong>, is how we communicate with computers.
Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.
You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
